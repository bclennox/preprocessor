Text Preprocessor
=================

Ruby module that I use on a couple of blogs as a shortcut to reference images, audio, footnotes, etc. It's very specific to my needs, but you might find something useful in it.

I'm maintaining [the docs](http://bclennox.com/projects/preprocessor) on my site now.
